# Chest X-Ray Image Classification using AlexNet

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance my skills in PyTorch coding and model training. The project will use the AlexNet architecture as the base model and will be trained on the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset.

## Objectives
- Gain experience in PyTorch coding and model training
- Train the AlexNet model on the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset
- Save the training parameters and create a training report automatically
- Use Docker containers for the training process
- Monitor the training status using TensorBoard

## Requirements
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorBoard
- Docker

## Dataset
The Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset will be used for this project. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## Model Architecture
The project will use the AlexNet architecture as the base model. AlexNet is a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) model that has been widely used for image classification tasks.

## Training Process
1. Preprocess the dataset and split it into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Set up the PyTorch model, loss function, and optimizer.
3. Train the model using the training set, and monitor the performance on the validation set.
4. Save the model parameters and create a training report automatically.
5. Use Docker containers to ensure a consistent and reproducible training environment.
6. Monitor the training status using TensorBoard.

## Training Report
The training report will be automatically generated after the training process is completed. The report will include the following information:
- Training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs
- Final model performance on the test set
- Hyperparameter settings
- Training time and computational resources used

## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance my skills in PyTorch coding and model training, with a focus on using the AlexNet architecture to classify chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection. The use of Docker containers and TensorBoard will ensure a robust and reproducible training process, and the automatic generation of the training report will provide valuable insights into the model's performance.
